         <p>Trek is a game of strategy. It is a single-player game played against the computer. The game is played on a
            3 columns x 20 rows rectangular grid.</p>
         <p>The computer places 3 rows of pieces at the top of the grid. The pieces are either a colored ⚪
            or a colored ✖️.</p>
         <img class="centerimage" src="img1.png">
         <p>The player must select a piece from each row. The selected pieces must not contain both a
            ⚪ and ✖️ of the same color. Once all selections are made, the computer places the pieces for the next
            row.</p>
         <img class="centerimage" src="img2.png">
         <p>When a new row is placed, it is possible that the player is unable to make a selection because it would
            conflict with previous selections. For eg: If the player has already selected a red ⚪, blue ✖️, green ✖️
            and the new row has a red ✖️, blue ⚪ and green ⚪, the player won't be able to make a selection from
            the new row.</p>
         <p>If the player makes an invalid selection, an error message
            <span id="messageBlock">Invalid selection</span> appears for about two seconds to warn the user and
            disappears. When this happens, the player has a
            choice to backtrack and change one or more of their previous
            choices and retry or forfeit the game. The player may directly click on a new piece to change it, provided
            it is a valid selection.</p>
         <p>If there are too many conflicts, they can clear all selections by clicking on the
            <strong>Clear</strong> link at the top of the page. This retains the pieces and clears the selections so
            that the player can make fresh selections.
         </p>
         <img class="centerimage" src="img3.png">
         <p>If the player is unable to make any valid selection, they forfeit. The
            player&apos;s objective is to make a valid selection across all rows of the game grid.</p>
         <p>The game can end with either the player winning or forfeiting due to being unable to make a valid selection
            in the last row.</p>
            <p>Finally, they can start a new game by clicking on the <strong>New game</strong> link at the top of the page. Happy trekking!</p>
